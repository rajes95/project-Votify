Code: 9/10
- missing most inner documentation and testing

Documents: 11/15
- in open-source, documentation is the most important feature. But there were only javadocs and system generated documents.
- no documents on any feature of the project.
- no documents on how to run the project locally.
- no videos, gifs, or instructions to show how the project works. If someone wants to contribute to this open source, they would not have any idea on how to do so.
