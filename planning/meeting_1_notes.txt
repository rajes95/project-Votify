Polling Compiler

-top 10 candidates based on custom weighted combined polls
-using api websites like pollster has an api

-info / news on each candidate upon click/hover over candidate

-slider for left/ right that changes the weights for the poll sources. 
	I.e. 1.4cnn + 0.3foxnews could be the left side, and 0.1cnn + 4.0foxnews could be right side

-start as java app, then put on server

-collect history of poll results over time and create history 


-future improvement is changing from automatic to manual 

-hover over feature that has limited info, and then click leads to ranked news

Pros:
-Easily modular

Roadblock:
-how to make it a website?
	-atlantis package?
	-github Pages
	-third party pages
	-html

	-Solution: do a desktop app
-how to handle votes with less candidates or more
